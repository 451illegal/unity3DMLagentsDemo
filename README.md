# unity3DMLagentsDemo
aiming at the pedestrian simulation using AGENT model, i decided to lower the complexity of the develop process as much as possible.
And i used the Unity open-source machine learning toolkit as a tool to get the point.
Thus you need to download and learn the demo at <https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/edit/master/README.md>
Download the v0.5 machine learning kit and add it into the asset folder is NECESSARY!
##build your own machine learning project(from unity)
More specific can be seen at(in Chinese) <https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/localized/zh-CN/docs/Learning-Environment-Create-New.md>, and you will find english edition in the website above.
